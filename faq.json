        "description": "It appears that you downloaded the vanilla resource/behavior pack, and are building your pack inside of it. This is bad practice for multiple overlapping reasons:\n\n1) It bloats pack size for anyone who downloads your addon.\n2) It negatively impacts performance in game.\n3) It makes it significantly more difficult to differentiate between what you added, and what is vanilla.\n\nYou should instead create a pack from scratch, by creating a blank folder, adding a `manifest.json`, and then slowly building up the required folders and files. If this is intimidating, you can reference the vanilla packs for folder structure and file-format inspiration.",

This field is used to decide when/how often the behavior will run.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f In general, the more important behaviors should be lower, like 0, or 1.\n\nWhen the entity is picking something to do, it searches all its behaviors from lowest priority to highest priority, and picks the first one that it can do. For this reason, you need to make important behaviors like `minecraft:behavior.nearest_attackable_target` lower than behaviors like `minecraft:behavior.look_at_player`. If the `look_at_player` is lower, it will always run this first when the player is close, and therefor will never move.",

The RP and BP that are passed to regolith as an input are copied to different location and than modified. The filter is basically any program/script which does something with resource pack or behavior pack.\n\nRegolith is a tool which hopefully will help people standarize the scripts that they use to speed up their workflows. Minecraft addon system is far from perfect and its often necessery to generate a lot of code. Regolith may help with making these code generators easier to reuse. Use of regolith isn't limited only to generating code. Some of the filters could be used for different task like printing some stats of the project, uploading some files to the internet or looking for errors.\n\nGitHub:\nhttps://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith\nWebsite:\nhttps://bedrock-oss.github.io/regolith/",

The first thing you should adjust is the, priority and the probability. \n\nThe next thing to realize is that Minecraft has hard-coded concept of `body` and `head` bones (groups). The `head` bone is hard-coded to react FIRST, then the rest of the bones follow. \n\nIf your entity has a head (like a dog), make sure to name the geometry correctly so that Minecraft can use this information. If your entity does NOT have a head (like a signboard, or a hologram), you should decide whether you want the entity to react FAST (name the top-bone `head`), or slow (name it `body`, or anything else).\n\nBeing aware of the bone names of `body` and `head` is one way you can make `look_at_player` react better.\n\nStill not happy? Get over it. Its just sometimes glitchy or slow. The component is designed to naturally make entities look at the player. Its not designed to instantly snap to their location. Even in a best-case scenario  you will need to deal with the hard-coded interpolation.",

It is pretty much impossible to maintain this documentation, since whenever a new version releases, mojang deletes all the old documentation and replaces it with the new version. Any edits we make are erased.\n\nThings like missing components, mislabeled queries or even outdated information is not the fault of destruction, and is rather the fault of Mojang. \n\nWe are looking into making documentation fixes persistent, but until that happens there is nothing we can do.",
